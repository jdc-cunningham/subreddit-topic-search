I'm adding some new features that I thought would be nice to have:
- [ ] tag that marks a result as having been commented on
- [ ] tag that marks a result as having written notes on locally eg. I looked into it, posted notes
- [x] add age of post and upvotes or comments count to indicate interest
- [ ] add second column on right to store commented posts
    - [ ] make columns 100% height so unique scrolling bars
